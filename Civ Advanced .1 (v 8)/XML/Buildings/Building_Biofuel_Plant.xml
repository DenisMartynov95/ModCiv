			<Text>A biofuel is a fuel that contains energy from geologically recent carbon fixation. These fuels are produced from living organisms.Bioethanol is by far the most common and is an alcohol made by fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]--Wikipedia</Text>
